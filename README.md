# Web-API-Quiz

Web-API-Quiz is a dynamic and interactive quiz application that tests your knowledge of JavaScript. The user interface, designed with a modern aesthetic, presents random JavaScript-related questions to the user within a given timeframe. Be careful though! Any incorrect answer will cost you ten seconds off your remaining time.

Upon completion of the quiz, you'll have an opportunity to review your score. For those who thrive on competition, there's an option to view the leaderboard of high scores and enter your initials to mark your achievement.
